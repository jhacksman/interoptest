# Interoperability Challenge

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to addressing Jon Groff's interoperability challenge, which involves creating bidirectional interoperability between two large codebases written in different programming languages.

## The Challenge
The challenge requires:

1. Taking two large codebases written in different programming languages
2. Analyzing the object models of both codebases
3. Generating code for full bidirectional interoperability between the object models using:
   - XML format
   - JSON format
   - Compact binary format

4. Generating middle tier implementations using:
   - MSMQ or other messaging bus
   - WebSockets
   - XMLRPC

## Implementation Requirements
Once the specific codebases and classes for interoperability are identified, the implementation will:

1. Analyze the object models of both codebases to understand their structure, properties, and methods
2. Create serialization/deserialization code for each format (XML, JSON, compact binary)
3. Implement middleware components for each communication protocol
4. Ensure type safety and proper error handling across language boundaries
5. Provide documentation on how to use the interoperability layer

## Status
Waiting for:
- Identification of the two codebases to be used
- Specification of which classes need to interoperate
- Any additional requirements or preferences for the implementation
